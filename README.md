# LetterByLetter
Show text letter one by one, i mean you know.......uh......i can't explain it well lol

auto generated text.....will be a further research....lol
i just had a mindblown there

---------------

What's New: 

- can trigger by empty <s>time and space</s> i mean non button

- <s>TSUNDERE LIIIINES~</s> vn style is "a little bit" odd now but i'll fix that later, but basically it's functioning

- really really really vn lookalike, <s>no extra references cause of <b>frustation</b></s> look VNStyleV2 for detail

---------------

Next:

- <b>BOLD</b>, <i>Italic</i>, <u>Underline</u>, color text will be implemented.....i'm still crawling lol

- hold a bit after the text all deployed

- also a settings for speed

---------------

Bug:

- <s>still find a way to stop the IEnumerator halfway.....and "if tap detected while the IEnumerator still walking with it's pace, stop it, text display em all without the IEnumerator"...this is only my personal note actually lol, don't take it seriously cause i already take it</s> <b>SPRAYED!</b>
