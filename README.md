# LetterByLetter
So....the name of this is Auto Type / Typewriter Style or i usually call it "Visual Novel Style"

i'll work this on both Unity and Android Studio, since they not treated the same

---------------

# What's New: 

- can trigger by empty <s>time and space</s> i mean non button (i mean emptyObject with added button and image)

- <s>TSUNDERE LIIIINES~ vn style is "a little bit" odd now but i'll fix that later, but basically</s> it's functioning now

- really really really vn lookalike, <s>no extra references cause of <b>frustation</b></s> look VNStyleV2 for detail

---------------

# Next:

- <b>BOLD</b>, <i>Italic</i>, <u>Underline</u>, color text will be implemented.....i'm still crawling lol

- hold a bit after the text all deployed

- also a settings for speed

---------------

# Bug:

- <s>still find a way to stop the IEnumerator halfway.....and "if tap detected while the IEnumerator still walking with it's pace, stop it, text display em all without the IEnumerator"...this is only my personal note actually lol, don't take it seriously cause i already take it</s> <b>SPRAYED!</b>
